## Description

In this mod, you can change the ***duration*** between two musics in the mod config.
Also, you can change the music that is playing depending your current ***music category*** *(see Commands section)*.
To keep Minecraft experience, you can't change category if you're not in creative but you can change this behavior in the config if you want.

The different music categories are: *GAME*, *NETHER*, *END*, *DISC*, *ALL*.

* **GAME:** Every music that you can play Overworld (survival and creative), in the water, or in the menu

* **NETHER:** Every music that you can play in the Nether

* **END:** Every music that you can play in the End, including dragon boss and credits musics

* **DISC:** Every music discs

* **ALL:** Anything you can find in other categories

## Commands

* **Skip music:** Play the next music of the same category. ***RIGHT ARROW key***

* **Pause/resume music:** Does it need explanations? ***LEFT ARROW key***

* **Change music category (creative only):** Change the current music category *(except ALL category!)* and play a music from this category. ***UP ARROW key***

* **Active random music player (creative only):** Change the current music category to the ALL category and play a random music. ***DOWN ARROW key***

* **Print music:** Print the category and the music currently playing. ***RIGHT CTRL key***

Note that you can change the keybinds at any moment in Minecraft control options.
