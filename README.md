# Music Control

## Description

This mod allows you to take full control of Minecraft music. If you ever felt like you had to wait too much time between
music, or if you ever wanted to skip a music, this mod is made for you.

And it doesn't stop here! You can switch music player mode to play music as before, discs only, resource pack/modded
music only, or any music of the game. You may also replay a music, display its name, and even change music volume
directly with keybinds.

Last but not least, you can completely customize which music plays when with a new GUI *(beta)*. In this music panel,
you can select any music or sound event to play it. You can also configure for each music, in which sound events it can
be played, and vice versa.
